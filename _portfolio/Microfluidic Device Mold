This project uses high resolution resin printing and CAD modelling to design and create a mold for a microfluidic device capable of sorting particles within a range of 125-150 µm and 425-500 µm. 
A mold will be designed in Fusion 360, printed using a Form 4 SLA printer, cast with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and sealed with *SUBSTRATE*

# CAD Modelling
### Design Specifications:
  * The device, when molded, must be precisely 25 mm wide by 75 mm long
  * The aspect ratio must be less than 4:1, i.e. the height of any feature must be now greater than 4 times its width.
  * For inlets and outlets a 1.5 mm post should be extruded above the top of the mold, this will create a hole that is compatible with the microfluidic barb
  * Inlets or outlets must be at least 11 mm away from each other
  * Channels must be at least 3 mm away from the edge of the device
  * There should be no features that cannot be demolded (cutbacks or small holes)
  * Features smaller than 85 µm cannot be printed
