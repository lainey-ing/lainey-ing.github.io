Up until recently I rode a Gotrax E-Scooter to work every day. The scooter retailed for $300, but it quickly paid for itself after I was able to forgo gas and a parking spot at work. However, after about a year and a half of driving the scooter daily the battery started to lose charge quickly and there were a couple other mechanical issues that forced me to stop riding the scooter. Instead of purchasing a new scooter, I decided to go the DIY route to build a one-off scooter that fits my needs.
