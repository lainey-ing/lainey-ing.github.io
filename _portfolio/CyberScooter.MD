For a class project we were tasked with creating a DIY syringe pump using only 3D printed components and provided parts. It is compatible with syringes of different diameters (20 mL to 10 mL). The pump is driven by a stepper motor coupled to a lead screw, and the flow rate is easily adjustable using an Arduino program, and can be set in mL/min for two different syringe diameters. It is also designed to have an LED that is green when running, yellow when paused, and red when out of liquid. A switch button was also included to automatically stop the plunger once it has fully dispensed liquid, and a pause button is included to momentarily halt it.
