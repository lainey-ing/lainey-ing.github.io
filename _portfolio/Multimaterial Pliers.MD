This project uses print-in-place parts 
Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. Perform external
research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What
combination of materials work well for print-in-place?

# CAD Model:

# Design Specifications
The handles are 90 mm long and the jaws are 45 mm. The jaws have a 6 by 14 mm area of surface to grip objects, and can hold objects with a width up to 10mm. The jaws and handles are made of PLA. The center connecting piece was printed out of TPU. The flexible material allows the jaws to close when the handles are squeezed. In the CAD model the center piece is a solid block, but by altering the print settings a more functional design can be created.

By removing the solid layers from the print a more flexible piece can be printed. The flexibility can be further adjusted by changing the percentage of infill, for my design I used 15% infill.
